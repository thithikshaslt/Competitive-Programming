## [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

**Level** : Easy apparently but it wasn't for me

---

### **Approach**

as you traverse the list, keep a track of the minimum most price encountered

also the maximum profit that can be made by subtracting the min_price from current element

The logic behind it lies in maintaining the minimum price seen so far and updating the maximum profit based on that minimum price.

Time Complexity : O(n)
