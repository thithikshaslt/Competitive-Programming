## [Move Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

**Level** : Easy

---

### **Initial Approach**
tried to just pop the 0 and append it at the end while iterating in a for loop, but the problem is consecutive 0's are not handled because i keeps on increasing without checking if after the removal of a zero, the current index contains a 0 or not.

---

### **Correct Approach**
the same but keep an extra variable to reset i back to the same value incase a 0 is found

Time Complexity : O(n) (one while loop)
