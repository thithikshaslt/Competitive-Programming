## [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

**Level** : Easy

---

### **Naive Approach**

two index variables, keep one constant and iterate over the rest of list to find a match

Time Complexity : O(n^2) (for inside while)

### **Better Approach**

in a hashmap (python dict) we store the elt:index as key:value pair. for every element in the list, we check if it's complement is present in the hashmap, if yes the index pair is returned else element is added to the dict

Why hashmap? 

1. Efficient lookups in O(1)
2. to efficiently retrieve the index when a match is found

Time Complexity : O(n) (one for loop)
